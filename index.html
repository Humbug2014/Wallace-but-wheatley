        <h2 id="The Beninging">Quarter One</h2>
        <p>Many years ago(actually just 2017) a weird blob named kirb appeared on the planet of waddle dee. that year, 
            a certain waddle dee(dubbed bandana dee) worked up the bravery to attack the opposing creature.
            year by year, battles were held, and after one event, unity was made.
            The battles became sport for the creatures.
        </p>


        <p>Yet another battle was being held, this time with magma infesting the arena. Bandana dee had the high ground,
            but kirb took is place in pico seconds. Bandana dee dodged kirb's ambush before seeing a figure behind him.
        the figure was Wallace. He had a task for Bandana dee and kirb. </p>

        

        <h2 id="A Change of Plans">Quarter Two</h2>
        <p>"I've lost my prized possesion!" Wallace said,"I've lost my golden cheese! we need to search egypt to find it!"
            kirb and Bandana dee knoded in agreement to help Wallace. The three went to the nearest spirit airlines to fly to Greater Cairo in egypt.
        </p>


        <p>The waddle dees and their ruler understood he quest was necessary, and decided to have a kingdom gaming tournament.  </p>


        

        <h2 id="The End....?">Quarter Three</h2>
        <p>THe three arrived in Egypt, and saw a weird passage with a sign above it reading"Golden cheese this way"
            Wallace exclaimed"We need to go check the passage way!"
            the group walked into the passage way, going underground. they reached an odd area which seemed to be some
            sort of obstacle course, so they began traversing it.
        </p>


        <p>WHen the got three quarters of the way through, they found a troubling puzzle that would need all of
            their wits. When they were about to ask wallace to help, however, he was nowhere to be found.
        </p>


    

        <h2 id="Portal 2">Final Quarter</h2>
        <p>After 54 tiring minutes, Bandana dee and kirb solved the puzzle. They walked through the room placed after,
            and heard a concerning lock behind them.Bandana dee was batle ready, and kirb was to powerful not to be ready,
            and infront of the two was a hologram of the golden cheese. they relized they had been bamboozled.
        </p>


        <p>A screen turned on in front of them, with wallace laughing maniacally."You've fallen into my trap,
            like many other powerful entities before you. my goal has always been to get rid of you to restore balance
            to this world!" kirb laughed off the stereotypical evil speech and teleported him and bandana dee back to
            thier home village... ( to be continued because I need to go to coding in 1 minute.)
